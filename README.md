##AboutThisApp 
This arcade game was created during the front end nanodegree through Udacity. Starter code was provided and I was required to get the board and character to interact with each other. I also needed to create and move the enemies. 

I utilized JavaScript in this activity. 

##HowToPlay:
Download or clone repository, extract the .zip file and open index.html in browser. 

The objective is to get player to water using the arrow keys and avoiding the bugs. If your character touches one of the bugs you will start back at the beginning. 

When you get to the water an alert will pop up saying you won and after clicking "OK" your character will automatically go back to the beginning.
